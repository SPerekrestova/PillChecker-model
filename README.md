# Medical NER & Linking Service

This service provides named entity recognition (NER) and entity linking for biomedical text using spaCy with a scispaCy model. It exposes a REST API built with FastAPI to process text and return entities along with their medical details.

> **⚠️ Note**: This project is a work in progress, created for educational purposes to explore new technology stacks and AI/ML possibilities. Some features may not be fully implemented or finalized.

## Overview

- **Input:** JSON payload with a text field.
- **Processing:** Loads the `en_ner_bc5cdr_md` scispaCy model and attaches the linker during startup. When a request is received, the model extracts entities and looks up additional details.
- **Output:** JSON response listing the entities with linking details (e.g., CUI, score, canonical name, and aliases).

## Architecture

- **FastAPI:** Provides the REST API endpoints.
- **spaCy & scispaCy:** Performs NER and linking. [ScispaCy Repo](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy)
- **RxNorm:** Linking pipeline which contains ~100k concepts focused on normalized names for clinical drugs. [RxNorm website](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html)
- **Health Check Endpoint:** A dedicated `/health` endpoint is provided to verify the application’s readiness.

## Features

- **/health Endpoint:** Returns a simple JSON indicating the service status.
- **/extract_entities Endpoint:** Accepts a JSON payload with a text field, performs NER and linking, and returns the extracted entities with additional details.

## Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ner-service .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 ner-service
   ```

3. Test the service:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "This text contains ibuprofen and paracetamol"}' \
     http://localhost:8000/extract_entities
   ```

---

## Usage

### Example: Python Client

```python
import requests

api_url = "http://localhost:8000/extract_entities"
text = "The patient took ibuprofen."

response = requests.post(api_url, json={"text": text})
if response.status_code == 200:
    print(response.json())
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

## API response example

````
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "text": "ibuprofen",
      "umls_entities": [
        {
          "canonical_name": "ibuprofen",
          "definition": "A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties",
          "aliases": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
````

## Model Notes

The application uses the `en_ner_bc5cdr_md` model from [Scispacy](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy) along with the [RxNorm](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html) linker. Make sure that any required model data is accessible at runtime. If not available locally, the model package can be installed via pip (refer to scispaCy’s documentation for details).

## Future Enhancements

- Make it possible to utilize full model pipeline (UMLS requires 10GB RAM to operate)
- Add support for **brand/trademark recognition**.
- Improve UMLS concept linking for ambiguous entities.
- Integrate additional NER models for multilingual support.
